# Modou-Lectures-Series
in progress of  building lectures series on the use of geospatial and computer vision deep learning for solving real world problem. 
we work from object detection to instance segmentation using Yolo and Segment Anything model. 
we will demonstrate how to fine tune SAM model using drone imageries and satellite data. 

1.  OpenCV 
2 . Tensorflow
3 . Pytorch
4  . Drone programming with computer vision
